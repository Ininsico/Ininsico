## Hi — I’m Arslan
Product-minded engineer building production ML, secure systems, and high-velocity developer workflows. I focus on shipping reliable, auditable systems that scale in the real world.

**What I do**
- Build and productionize ML models with end-to-end infra (training → deployment → monitoring).  
- Design and implement secure, observable systems for offensive/defensive engineering workflows.  
- Rapid prototyping: small fast iterations that turn into reliable products.

---

## Core areas
- **Applied Machine Learning** — model ops, training pipelines, eval/robustness  
- **Security & Reverse Engineering** — threat modelling, binary/firmware analysis, exploit hardening  
- **Production Engineering** — CI/CD, containers, infra-as-code, observability  
- **Systems Architecture** — scalable primitives, event-driven design, resilience

---

## Current focus
1. Shipping containerized ML infra with reproducible experiments.  
2. Building tooling for secure model evaluation and hardening.  
3. Public experiments & writing that show engineering trade-offs and reproducible results.

## Selected highlights
- **Production ML pipeline** — Designed a reproducible training + CI system that reduced deployment time from weeks to hours.  
- **Secure model evaluation** — Built automated adversarial testing harnesses for model robustness and audit trails.  
- **Reverse-engineering toolset** — Developed internal tooling for firmware analysis and secure binary triage.  
- **Observability at scale** — Implemented tracing + metrics + alerting for critical services (SLO-driven).

## Featured / Pinned projects
> _Paste repo links under your profile pins. Keep 3 — 5 repos: a production system, an infra-tool, and an educational demo._

- **Production-ML-Infra** — reproducible training pipelines, CI, and deployment manifests.  
  `github.com/Arslan/production-ml-infra`

- **secure-eval-harness** — adversarial testing and auditing for models (pluggable backends).  
  `github.com/Arslan/secure-eval-harness`

- **reverser-lab** — curated reverse-engineering toolkit and labs (firmware examples + writeups).  
  `github.com/Arslan/reverser-lab`

- **mini-products** — fast prototypes that became observability demos / blog posts.  
  `github.com/Arslan/mini-products`

---

## How I work
- Small experiments → rigorous metrics → ship minimal reliable surface.  
- Automate the boring parts (testing, deployment, observability).  
- Document decisions with reproducible artifacts (not just notes).

> **To keep this professional + animated:**  
> 1. Keep the animated header (typing SVG) but use a muted palette (done above).  
> 2. Use 3–5 pinned repos that showcase production readiness.  
> 3. Replace placeholders (`your_handle`, `your.email@example.com`) with real links.
